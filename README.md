sublime-alphabetize-lines
=========================

Sublime Text 2 plugin to alphabetize a set of lines

Usage
-------

Add to your packages et voila! OSX: "Command + Control + s" will activate it; all others, "Control + Alt + s"

Especially useful when alphabetizing a list of imports at the top of a file.

i.e.

```
from django import settings
from dog import dingo
from authorize import api
```

will be alphabetized and replaced with

```
from authorize import api
from django import settings
from dog import dingo
```

yay!
